## Project Description

This is the project of the group WE_64 for the module Software Project Management(SE3080), Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology(SLIIT).

Goal of this project is to develop an online web application of a hotel management system which can do all the activities like making reservations, ordering
food, and managing employees and rooms/reception halls. It contains user-friendly interfaces for easy handling. And the system is mainly based on
Customer requirements. There are two main user roles as Customer and Admin. The main functions which are identified in here are,

* Restaurant Management
* Room and Reception Hall Management
* Reservation Management
* Employee Management

The system consists of four main interconnected components. They are the Website, Admin front-end, system back-end and the database server. So, this
web application is going to be implemented using React, Axios for the front-end and NodeJS, ExpressJS for the backend with MongoDB as the
database.
The system's main four functions are divided among the group members. In Restaurant Management, it includes an attractive and a detailed page of
the food menus in the restaurant. System administrator is responsible for managing this page. Administrator is able to add new food items to the
menu. Admin can update the food menu and also can delete. According to the customers preference, they can go through the food menu and can get
a clear idea about the hotels’ restaurant service. They can also easily find details of their favorite food by using the search bar. In Room and
Reception Hall Management, it includes the details of the hotel room, and the reception hall services. Here also, the system administrator is the
person who’s responsible to manage the page. Admin can add new room and reception hall details. Also have access to edit and delete those details.
Customers can go through these pages and get a good idea about the hotels’ room services and the reception hall services. Because these pages also
include pictures of the rooms, reception halls with detailed information. Also, here also they can easily search using keywords or else they can filter
their needs according to their preference. Reservation Management includes the page where the customers can reserve rooms and reception halls.
After going through the rooms and reception hall details, customers can reserve available rooms according to their needs. All the reserve
management is done by the system administrator. Finally, in Employee management Admin is supposed to add new employees to the hotel system
as well as admin can edit and delete those employee details. Using the search bar admin can find employees with their details. Apart from those,
through the admin dashboard, the administrator has the ability to generate a report on any of those sections.
